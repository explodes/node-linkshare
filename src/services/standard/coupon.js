/**
 * Using the Coupon Web Service
 * The LinkShare Coupon Web Service gives you easy access to coupon and promotional link data for your advertisers. All of the links are reviewed by LinkShare to ensure that they are indeed coupon or consumer promotional links. To receive this creative, you simply place a REST-based Web Services call with your feed token. (For a PDF of these guidelines and an XML schema, please click here: , or see the attachment at the end of the article.)
 * 
 * Submitting a Coupon Web Service Request
 * A REST-based Web Service lets you request a feed using a query structured like an HTML GET. The inputs to the query are your Web Services token, the product category, the promotion type, the network, an advertiser ID (MID), the number of results per page, and the page number. Your Web Services token is required; the other values are optional.
 * 
 * Here is a sample request that excludes MID:
 * 
 * http://couponfeed.linksynergy.com/coupon?token=94e973c41fe2c696de23a111b91b6182ae73cf3ee4dddb0eefa0091c266cc5ea&
 * category=4169&promotiontype=21&network=1&resultsperpage=100&pagenumber=2
 * 
 * This query will send coupon and promotional link data for up to one hundred advertisers that you are partnered with in network 1 who have products in category 4169 that correspond with offer-promotion type 21.
