## Construction

	var linkshare = require('node-linkshare');
	var api = new linkshare('my token', 'my secure token');

Most services take arguments in the form of:

	params   :: Object
	callback :: void Function(RequestError || Response error, String body, Response response) 
	
e.g.

	api.coupons(Object params, Function callback)
	api.merchantquery(Object params, Function callback)
	api.targeted(Object params, Function callback)
	api.paymenthistory(Object params, Function callback) *
	api.textlinks(Object params, Function callback)
	api.bannerlinks(Object params, Function callback)
	api.drmlinks(Object params, Function callback)
	api.productlinks(Object params, Function callback)
	
Exceptions to this rule are:
	
	api.linkgenerator(String mid, String murl, Function callback)
	api.advertiserpayments(String payid, Function callback) *
	api.paymentdetail(String id, boolean isInvoiceId, Function callback) *
	api.advertiserinfo(String || Integer parameter, String type, Function callback) 
	api.creativecategories(Integer mid, Function callback)
	
* indicates that securetoken is required to use.
